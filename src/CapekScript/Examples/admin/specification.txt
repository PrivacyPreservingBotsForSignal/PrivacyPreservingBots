            - Can create/delete channels (!createChannel/!deleteChannel <channel>)
            - Can grant/revoke channel admins
    - Channel specific admins

                - Can add/remove users (!add/!remove <channel> <user>)
            - Can modify permissions of each user (except other admins) (!permission <channel> <user> <permission>)
                - 0: read
                - 1: write
                - 2: admin

- Channels
    - When created:
        - User list is empty
    - permissions
        - Each user has a permission level
            - 0: read
            - 1: write
            - 2: admin

- users
    - Are able to send messages (!send <channel> <message>)
        - If they have the permission to write the channel
        - Otherwise message will be ignored
    - Are able to receive messages
        - If they have the permission to read the channel
        - If message is valid (has correct permissions)
