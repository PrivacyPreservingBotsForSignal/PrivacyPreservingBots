## What is CapekScript

CapekScript is an interpretted programming language for writing bots for use with instant messaging solutions like Signal. It is heavily based on S-Expressions and is used with the Signal-Bot-Client to run secured bot code with privilege control systems. My strongly controlling side effects like external fetching of data and outputting messages to users through the interpreter, the client is capable of controlling what each bot is permitted to do. For example, should a bot not be permitted to fetch data any longer, the interpretter may simply refuse to execute fetch commands for the bot. 

## What does the name mean?

Karel ÄŒapek was a Csech author and journalist. CapekScript takes its name from him in large part due to the fact he coined the term "robot" from which bot is derived.
